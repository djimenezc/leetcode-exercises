"""
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.



Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3


Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

    # Intuition
    # Check 4 directions. (top, right, bottom, left) from each place.
    # If we find "1", we will keep the place(row and column).
    #
    # But one problem is that we will keep the places where we already visited,
    # so to prevent revisiting the same places, we also keep the places where we already visited.
    # If we find "1" and the place is not visited yet, keep it.
    # This algorithm will visit all "1" places with one BFS operation if the places are connected in the same island,
    # that means every time we start new BFS operation, the place is one of new islands.
