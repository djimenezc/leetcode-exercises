"""
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

The XOR operation has two useful properties:

( x \oplus x = 0 ): XORing a number with itself results in 0.
( x \oplus 0 = x ): XORing a number with 0 keeps the number unchanged.

By XORing all elements in the array, the elements that appear twice will cancel each other out
(since ( x \oplus x = 0 )), leaving only the single element that appears once.

Approach :
Initialize a variable result to 0.
Iterate through each number in the array:
XOR the number with result.
After the loop, result will contain the single number that doesnâ€™t appear twice.
